# Drivers API

This repo contains some code I built when I was studying the MongoDB course of [Stephen Grider at Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb/). It uses nodemon, mongodb agreggations and geolocation features and mocha on the tests.

You can install the dependencies, execute the tests and run the project by using:
```
yarn install
yarn test
yarn dev
```
